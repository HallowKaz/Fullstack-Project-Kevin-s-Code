# movieapp
This app allows the user to search a Movie name, and retrieve some basic details about it from the tmdb api. The user most clone the repo, and make a config.js file that exports their tmdb api key. For example:
![example config.js file](https://github.com/KevinInfanteFAU/movieapp/blob/main/config_example.jpg?raw=true)


Then they can run the server with node, and access the website at: http://localhost:3000
